### Description
How to concretely build an open project? This week you will go through a set of principles, values and tools that will help you lower access barriers for users and contributors. You will then apply them to start creating the building blocks of your project.

### Goal of the week
Create entry points to your project for contributors and users, in the most accessible way.

### Content

- How to describe your project and tasks in a way that other people can contribute to them
- Version Control
- Modularity
- Minimal viable project
- Docs for users/devs/building
  - Differentiate between user and developer branches/versions
  - Documentation needs to be easy to use/modify (using mature OS tools and text formats contributes to that)
- Responsible Innovation


### Assignments
- Make a plan for your documentation (see resources)
- Create a README or basic project introduction
- Write contribution guidelines considering your identified areas for improvement and development
