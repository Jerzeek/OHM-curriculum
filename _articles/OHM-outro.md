Congratulations! You are very close to the end of the program. Now it is time to look back and realise what you have learned and built over the last 14 weeks and think how to use the learnings for your current and future projects.

### Goal of the Week
Look back, learn and define future steps, celebrate and prepare your project for the final call

<!--### Assignments (to be distributed among submodules)
- The 3â€™ video or something condensing the main idea of the project for a general audience + links to docs for showcasing on the OHM website
- Think of 2 or 3 good indicators for your own project according to your pathway
- Do one final revision of your project and prepare it for the final demo call-->
