### Content
- Document in a way that is understandable to others; specialists and newcomers alike.
  - The same guidelines used to describe your project to people seeing it for the first time apply to the documentation of your project: 
  
    - Different people will have different interests in your project. Some might just want to use what you are developing (and they may or may not have previous skills in building open hardware). Some people might want to join efforts in developing with you, some might want to build a derivative of your work, using it as a starting point for something new.  Just from this three examples, we can imagine that we need to cover different aspects of our project. How can I guide people to guide one? How can I guide people to use it? How can I make co-development easier by setting out clear explanations on what is the expected way to work together?
  
    - People reading it will have different skill levels and  should not have to spend a lot of time looking for the meaning of a certain jargon or words they never saw before. Think broadly, can a person who has never build anything build and use this? Can an expert do the same?
    
    - A good approach to document things is to split it into to different documents each focused on one use case, as this allows documenting to be a bit more tractable and also reading/watching it more manageable. One suggestion would be one document for using, one for building and one for developing. 

- Organized, e.g. skills necessary to do “x” task
  - One way to prepare people for building and using your project, is to make a list of the tools and skills necessary to complete it.
- Video documentation (time stamp it, damn it) (open community subtitles, damn it)    
- Collaborative translation
