### Digital fabrication
    - Editable formats
      - Mentee must understand that the open hardware best practices and definition are not bureaucracies that must be filled, itâ€™s guidelines that make openness stronger.
      - FOSH religious approaches
    - provide source files (e.g. CAD files) and export files (e.g. STP, STL, PDF)
    - Differentiate between docs for building and for dev (heavy repos, bad connections)     
  - Electronics
  - Biomaterials
  - Textiles
  - Building instructions/Assembly guide/Recipe
