summary: "For others to discover, contribute to, learn from, and re-use your project, it needs to be on the world wide web. We recommend using a web-based software platform called GitHub, which helps you with one of the main challenges in collaborating with lots of volunteers on a single project. This challenge is “version control,” the task of managing the many contributions your group makes to shared working documents. This module explains the more about version control, and how GitHub can help."
