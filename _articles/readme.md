### Intro into Open Hardware Makers

The training consists of nine sections, each containing a set of modules on a topic related to working open. In each module, youâ€™ll learn by reading, watching short videos, and completing hands-on assignments. The assignments build on each other, so this training works best if you do the modules in order. The seven sections are:
