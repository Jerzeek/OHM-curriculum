### A field recognition guide

As an introduction to the open hardware world, we think it is important to have a general view of the landscape. Which are the organizations you will probably hear about frequently, what do they do... Where did all these people come from?!

As with many other communities and movements, the practice of sharing the designs of hardware was happening out there before the label emerged. Ham radio, artists, community scientists, scientists in academia, open innovation practices in business... Are only some examples.

#### Definitions and licenses
One of the acronyms you will hear often is OSHWA, the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://oshwa.org). Born in 2012, OSHWA is the home of the Open Source Hardware definition created in 2010. It is a US-based non-profit that also hosts the annual Open Hardware Summit, and maintains the Open Source Hardware certification program. 

As OSHWA mentions in its brief history of open hardware:
 
>[...] open source hardware only became known as such in the last decade. This was mostly due to the rise of the internet, which made sharing hardware designs possible, the commercial success of open source software, which gave it public visibility, and the decrease in cost of production tools, which made it feasible. 

To define its core values, the open hardware community drew inspiration from a set of communities working in similar spaces: the open source and free software movements, the ham radio tradition, the Homebrew Computer Club and hacker culture in general.

Another acronym you will frequently find is CERN. And yes, we are talking about the european organization for nuclear research. As early as 2008 a team at CERN started developing open hardware, emulating the practices of open source software teams. This work resulted in important early achievements, such as the open hardware repository and later on the CERN Open Hardware License (CERN-OHL). We'll learn more about the license in module 6.


#### Communities 
Some open hardware projects and their communities became so popular that you will hear about them, or the paradigm they represent, really often. One of these examples is Arduino, which enabled thousands to prototype electronic designs in an accessible way. Another example of incredibly active branch is the 3D printing community, where you can find people working on different models, since the first RepRap to one of its current grand-grand-daughters, Prusa. 

Most communities gather around the field of application of what they are building. Somes examples? You will find often about the Do It Yourself (DIY), often called "maker" community, tweaking and creating designs as a hobby or for education. When it comes to science, the Global Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community brings together people in or outside academia building tools for science and education. Networks like Hackteria gather lots of artists working with open hardware and DIY biology, while Appropedia collects open designs of tools for sustainable living. Open hardware is also growing more everyday in business, with communities like OpenCores, but also with more and more small businesses that in different domains recognize the value of openness for creating better products.

#### Platforms

Online communities also form around platforms for sharing designs (Hackaday, Instructables, Hackster, KitSpace, etc) or tools needed for designing and building hardware. We will dive more into the specifics on module 4.

The diversity is huge and may feel a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but no worries: we will help you to connect your project and ideas to this super active world. Contributing to projects you like is one of the best ways to introduce yourself to the community! 

### {{ site.assignment }} Cool open hardware projects

As part of the consultation process that gave origin to this curriculum, we asked experts to mention open hardware projects that they feel are key to the community.

Take a look at the list here.

- Read through the list and pick a project you find interesting
- Write 2-3 reasons why you think the project is interesting, and be ready to share with your peers in the next cohort call
