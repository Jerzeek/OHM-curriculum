### The meeting point
As we saw in the previous section, the routes your open hardware project can take are many. Although this diversity, all these projects follow (or should follow) the principles stated by the open hardware definition:

> “Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.” 

When we say “Hardware” we refer to any physical, tangible artefact: Machines, electronic devices, paperweights, textiles. This adds a layer of complexity that free/open source software doesn't have to deal with: their source is plain text code. In the case of hardware, you may share a quick sketch and a description of your machine under a free/open license, but is this enough to allow others to work on it?

We will learn more about this in modules 3 and 4, but in order to enable people to “study, modify, distribute, make and sell” our hardware, we need to provide access to different types of information. These vary according to the kind of product you are working on. As an example, if your hardware includes electronics, you should be able to provide the schematics. However, for mechanical products this wouldn’t be necessary; instead your focus will be on CAD files, assembly instructions, etc. We will go through these specifics in one of the units of this program.

### Diverging pathways

Open hardware allows us to produce tools in a certain transparent, sometimes collaborative way. As tools, they are designed with a diversity of purposes in mind. And this is where projects start diverging.

Probably the most visible difference is that some open hardware projects are conceived as products from the very beginning and others not (although they may turn into products later). For example, some open hardware projects are born as part of a master's student thesis, or as a project by a teacher who wants to get better results in the classroom. Or maybe a hobbyist that is sharing their last cool invention, or a community that needs to monitor the air pollution in their environment, and works together with scientists to develop a new design adapted to their needs.  

In each of these areas, business, education, science, collective action, art... Open hardware becomes a powerful tool to achieve different purposes. Although you are probably only in an initial stage, it is convenient to start looking at which is the purpose of your project, and how it relates to others out there. But no worries, we will learn more about that in the next module.


### {{ site.assignment }} Expectations

For now, think about the different pathways your project could take:

- Would you like to turn your project into a commercial product? Or are you looking to document an educational project, share your latest art, communicate a powerful advocacy tool? 

Write 2 or 3 bullet points to discuss your expectations with your mentor.
