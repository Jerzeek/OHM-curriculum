### Contents

- Open hardware growth and multiple platforms/formats
- The need for findability standards
- OpenKnowHow project and derivatives, and how to implement it

In parallel to the documentation standardisation, there are people working on findability and assertion of OSH quality. The Open KnowHow project has created a system that allows projects to be found, no matter in which platform they are hosted. This is done by adding a small file to the documentation of the project. In this standard file, developers should add information about their project in a specific format. This information should include links to where documentation is hosted, whether or not the project has been reproduced by a third party, if the documentation is available in different languages, if the work is a derivative of another project, keywords for the project, etc. Once a project has this file, a webcrawler finds and indexes it in a searchable  repository which serves as a unifying place for all the projects that live in many different platforms.
