Following an open spirit, we build on top of what others have already done before us. Many people have worked on what openness means for hardware, discussed the minimum requirements for documentation, or how to make projects findable.

This week you will take a look into open source hardware licenses, the open hardware certification program ([OSHWA Standard](https://certification.oshwa.org/)), documentation standards ([Open Hardware DIN SPEC 3105](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/DIN_SPEC_3105)) and how to make your project easy to find ([OpenKnowHow project](https://openknowhow.org/)). These are powerful instruments if you know how to use them; you will reflect on how these can be useful for your project, and apply them to your work.

### Goal of the week
Understand the different open licensing and certification options available and increase the findability of your project
