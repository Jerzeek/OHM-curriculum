### Hardware standards:
  - The importance of standards (compatibility, reproducibility, repairability, guideline)  
  - What is a suitable standard for my project?
  - Examples of open standards and how to apply them to your project (eg DIN spec)
  - What are the standards in your region? (Europe CE, Brazil INMETRO, etc)


One important point to observe from open source projects is that due to their distributed nature, they normally do not follow one specific standard. In other words, as project X is brought to reality, its developers might have had a certain train of thought on how to organised their documentation, and this can be completely different from what the developers Y have thought about. Although this is in principle ok, as in theory all projects should be documented well enough for anyone to understand them, it does bring the added complexity of having to navigate through different documentation styles, and that are made to different completion levels. 

If there were standards for open source hardware that was widely used by the community, then everyone could benefit from streamlined productions and repairability of existing hardware, easiness in navigating the documentation of different projects, and having an easier time finding open source hardware (as today there are so many different platforms that could host OSH projects, but no common indexed system for searching them).

Luckily the issue of standardisation is not new, and countries/regions have their own standardisation systems, which means that standardisation in OSH does not have to start from zero and there is at least one standard for OSH that worked together with the [DIN](https://www.din.de/en) (Deutsches Institute fuer Normung - The German Institute for Standardization) to create the [DIN standard for OSH documentation](https://journalopenhw.medium.com/din-spec-3105-explained-2cce6134c207). These documents can be found here and here and outline how documentation should be prepared to conform with these DIN standards. One thing to note is that the DIN Spec for OSH was made with an industry/commercialisation goal in mind, so conforming with this spec is not complicated, but a bit time consuming.


### {{ site.assignment }} Bring your documentation closer to a chosen standard

- Go through the standards and see which applies for your project
- Revisit your documentation and adjust it. 
- Follow our checklist to update your documentation so it is one step closer to fulfill [DIN SPEC 3105](https://gitlab.com/OSEGermany/OHS/uploads/b35d1b22a3ec13f968de08c6b106cbda/DIN_SPEC_3105_v0.10.0.zip)
