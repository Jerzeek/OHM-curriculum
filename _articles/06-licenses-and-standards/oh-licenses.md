### Hardware licenses available (TAPR OHL, Solderpad, CERN-OH)

Similar to open software licenses, developers have the opportunity of choosing from more than one available license. At the moment, there are three main hardware licenses available:
- [TAPR OHL](https://tapr.org/the-tapr-open-hardware-license/) - similar to GNU GPL license
- [Solderpad](http://solderpad.org/) - similar to Apache license
- [CERN-OH](https://ohwr.org/cernohl) - the most recent version (v2.0) has three variants: 
  - A strongly-reciprocal variant, [CERN-OHL-S](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.pdf)
  - A weakly-reciprocal variant, [CERN-OHL-W](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_w_v2.pdf)
  - A permissive variant, [CERN-OHL-P](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_p_v2.pdf)

Each of the CERN variants try give users options in terms of how derivatives of their projects should be reshared. For example, one can think of the CERN-OHL-S as Similar to Creative Commons "share alike".

All these licenses had a lot of thought put on them, by a many people that have been part, or working with open source projects for a long time, so choosing one is more a matter of how you want others to use your project and how they share derivatives. 

[NOTE: add comment about date of last revision of licenses]

### Examples of projects using different licenses

To give you a better idea of how different licenses are used in the existing projects, please have a look at these examples:

- [OpenFlexure delta stage](https://gitlab.com/openflexure/openflexure-delta-stage).
- 

Other than these examples, a good source for more projects that are properly licensed and documented can be found on the [OSHWA repository](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html)

### {{ site.assignment }} Choose licenses for your project
- Choose a license or several licenses depending on the types of content you are providing.
  - Remember a hardware project normally needs at least 3 licenses.
- If you are using parts of other projects with licenses check if you attribute them correctly
