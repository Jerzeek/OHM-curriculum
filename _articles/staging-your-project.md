### Description

Meet this week with your mentor! You will scope your project using our open hardware canvas, which will guide you through the building blocks of an open hardware project. By looking at it, your mentor should get a general idea about your project's main components (software, electronics, casing, bio materials, etc.), its status and stage, if you have a prototype already, which contributions you need and what you want to achieve.

### Goal of the week
Draft the scope of your project by creating an open hardware canvas

### Assignments (to distribute in the submodules)   
- Look for similar projects
- Write a short "Purpose and Outcome" for your project
- Review your project and fill out the Open Hardware Makers canvas
- Share your canvas with your mentor (& organizers?)s
