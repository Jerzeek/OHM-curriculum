Documenting open hardware projects isnâ€™t the same as documenting software development. In this module we take a moment to learn about which aspects of hardware projects need to be made explicit, and the best way to do so. You will then apply this to your own project, to ensure anyone can interact with it in an open way.

### Goal of the Week
Align your project documentation with current best open hardware practices
