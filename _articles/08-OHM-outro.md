Congratulations! You are very close to the end of the program. Now it is time to look back and realise what you have learned and built over the last 14 weeks and think how to use the learnings for your current and future projects.

Before you begin this section, gather together the offline and online materials and documentation youâ€™ve assembled over the course of your OHM journey.

### Goal of the Week
Look back, learn and define future steps, celebrate and prepare your project for the final call
