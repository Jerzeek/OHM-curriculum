### What is OHM?

[Open Hardware Makers](http://openhardware.space) (or OHM) is an online mentorship program. Inspired by [Mozilla Open Leadership](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/open-leadership-events/vault/open-leaders/) programs, it aims to support new hardware projects in their way of acquiring **best practices, building welcoming and inclusive communities and connecting to existing networks.**

During the 15-weeks program participants will follow our curriculum and apply the learnings to their own projects, with the aim of presenting a public demo at the end. Through the learning process participants join a weekly call, alternating between 1:1 meetings with their mentor and group calls with their peers. Projects also receive assessment from a round of experts that give them input on specific aspects of their work.

Close to the final weeks, the program runs a global sprint to expose projects to potential collaborators and foster peer-to-peer interaction. Each cohort of OHM closes with a public demo call where participants showcase their projects to the community.

If you are here as a mentee of OHM, make sure you familiarize yourself with the contents of this "module zero" before you move on!
