Thinking about what you eventually want to achieve with your project is a good way to understand what are the core things you need to focus time and energy on. Roadmapping is a tool to visualize this and create defined actionable steps that will help you and contributors to know exactly what to work on and the current stage of development.

### Goals of the week
Define a roadmap of actionable steps towards your project goal, to be assessed by the program experts, learn about assessment tools and time management in open source.
