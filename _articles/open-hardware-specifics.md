### Description
Documenting open hardware projects isn’t the same as documenting software development. When building a physical object, having a proper description of the materials used and why they were chosen makes it easier for everyone to use it, modify it or replicate it. In this module we take a moment to learn about which aspects of hardware projects need to be made explicit, and the best way to do so. You will then apply this to your own project, to ensure anyone can interact with it in an open way.

### Goal of the Week
Align your project documentation with current best open hardware practices

### Content
- Document in a way that is understandable to others; specialists and newcomers alike.
  - Skills necessary to do “x” task
- Minimal viable documentation for building or contributing
  - Bill of materials
    - Access to materials in diff parts of the world
  - Digital fabrication
    - Editable formats
      - Mentee must understand that the open hardware best practices and definition are not bureaucracies that must be filled, it’s guidelines that make openness stronger.
      - FOSH religious approaches
    - provide source files (e.g. CAD files) and export files (e.g. STP, STL, PDF)
    - Differentiate between docs for building and for dev (heavy repos, bad connections)     
  - Electronics
  - Biomaterials
  - Textiles
  - Building instructions/Assembly guide/Recipe
- Minimal viable documentation for users
  - Tutorials
  - Examples
  - FAQ
  - Where to find downloads and stuff
- Video documentation (time stamp it, damn it) (open community subtitles, damn it)    

### Assignments
- Revisit your contribution guidelines and documentation plan
- Dive deeper into your building documentation following the practices in this unit:
- Minimal viable documentation for users
- Minimal viable documentation for builders/contributors
