### Our approach
We are aware that open hardware projects are as diverse in their aims, strategies and features as their creators. With the vision of reaching as many projects as possible to make them reusable, we propose a series of **principles and concrete practices that are applicable to any open hardware project.** These principles and practices include (but are not limited to):
- Documentation
- Discoverability
- Specifications and standards
- Appropriate licences
- Managing contributions

The program supports participants by **connecting them to a pool of experts** who can provide support in different domains (technical, community builders, business experts, etc.). In this way, we expect OHM can grow and continue supporting participants making open hardware projects even when areas of expertise change rapidly or are replaced by new paradigms.

During the last years we have seen an incredible growth in the number of platforms that offer hosting for open hardware documentation. In this program **we invite creators to use the documentation platform better suited for their purposes** and community rather than making specific recommendations. We encourage practices that enable collaboration and increase discoverability across these multiple platforms.

#### Learning goals
You will learn and apply best practices in order to design and build an open source hardware project in a collaborative way.

**Participants who complete OHM will be able to:**
- Understand what openness means for hardware projects
- Understand the role of their project in the open hardware community
- Build a fully-reusable project and make it easier for others to find it
- Understand & promote cooperation, diversity and inclusion in open hardware
