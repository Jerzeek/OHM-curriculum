### Who is Open Hardware Makers for?
The goal of Open Hardware Makers is to support the development of early stage open hardware projects around the world. We want to ensure they are reusable, and they foster a diverse and inclusive global open source hardware community.

OHM is for any person or team starting a hardware project in any part of the world regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or professional background. You may want to use it for educational purposes, turn it into a product, build a big community around it, open an existent closed project, etc. In any case, this program will support you in making your project open for anyone to reuse.
