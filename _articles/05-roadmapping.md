Thinking about what you eventually want to achieve with your project is a good way to understand what are the core things you need to focus time and energy on. Roadmapping is a tool to visualize this and create defined actionable steps that will help you and contributors to know exactly what to work on. It is also useful to track the current stage of development for yourself and others.

### Goals of the week
Define a roadmap of actionable steps towards your project goal, to be assessed by the program experts, learn about assessment tools and time management in open source.
