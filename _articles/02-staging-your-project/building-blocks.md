If you made it here, you have a broad idea about what is open hardware, a brief context of how the community emerged, different options for open hardware projects. You also had some time to think on the goals and scope of your work, if you are making a derivative or creating original designs, and you probably have a rough draft of the open hardware canvas. Congratulations!

In this submodule we are seeking to understand which are the basic elements that constitute an open hardware project, and give a brief overview of each of them. 

### The minimum you need to get there

The idea of introducing the open hardware canvas is to help you identify those minimum components, or needs and resources that are critical to create a simple version of your project that meets the key goals you defined. 

While you may have ideas or plans for an extended, enhanced version of your project– for example you may want to eventually expand from successfully measuring noise levels to having a fancy dashboard for users to visualize data- it’s always best to build your proof of concept first. This way, you can test out the project and ensure the idea works before you spend lots of time and resources expanding it. If you find your project is too complex to fit into the Open Hardware Canvas model, it may be that you’re trying to do too much, and need to narrow your scope.

Depending on the type of approach you are taking, the first steps will vary. If you are creating original designs, you will probably want to make a proof of concept first - can your idea be achieved? Usually when you make a derivative you know the main concept works and you are looking to improve it, so you go directly to the next step, prototyping. 

Prototyping is an incredibly valuable exercise that allows you to visualize how the project will function. It is a working interactive model of the end product that gives an idea of the design, navigation and layout. The ability to quickly and easily prototype an idea is one of the drivers behind the incredible number of open hardware projects we see today. 

### The minimum you need to make it open
 
So, the prototype will allow you to test how your idea will be developed and worked. But which are the minimum requirements for your project to be **open**?

- **Licenses**: Properly applying an open source hardware license to your project ensures that downstream users can use it. Licensing hardware is more complicated than licensing software, as hardware projects usually include hardware plus software, documentation, branding. Each different component requires a different type of license.

- **Source files**: All the necessary files to be able to build your project and modify it. This means, source files in *editable formats*, including schematics, CAD designs, firmware, software. 

- **Instructions**: More robust documentation makes it easier for downstream users to build, use, and iterate on your project. This includes a bill of materials, user guides, assembly instructions, contribution guides. Best projects include documentation in multiple formats, tutorials, translations.

Think of this as a bird view of what you will see next, in each of the following sections. 

<!-- ### {{ site.assignment }} Your minimum viable project -->

- Go back to your canvas, review what you wrote, see if you can put more detail into any of the boxes.

- Do you already have ideas for prototypes? Document your drafts! Taking pictures is a great way to do it. 

- If you still don't know where to start, think of the non-negotiable features of your project. You will probably have to refer back to your vision and scope in order to prioritize.
