### Description
Following an open spirit, we build on top of what others have already done before us. Many people have worked on what openness means for hardware, discussed the minimum requirements for documentation, or how to make projects findable. This week you will take a look into open source hardware licenses, the open hardware certification program (OSHWA Standard), documentation standards (Open Hardware DIN SPEC 3105) and how to make your project easy to find (OpenKnowHow project). These are powerful instruments if we know how to use them; you will then reflect on how these can be useful for your project, and apply them to your work.

### Goal of the week
Understand the different open licensing and certification options available and increase your project findability

### Content
- Why are patents so bad and how intellectual property (Copyright and others) is handled in open hardware

- Licenses
  - Licenses and their characteristics (e.g. how to cite/attribute, compatibility)
  - Whatâ€™s the best license for your project.
  - Hardware projects require at least two/three licenses: one for the hardware itself, one for documentation and one for the software:
    - Cover the most common ones and tools to help people decide
      - CERN
      - CC
      - MIT / GNU GPL

- Hardware standards:
  - The importance of standards (compatibility, reproducibility, repairability, guideline)  
  - What is a suitable standard for my project?
  - Examples of open standards and how to apply them to your project
  - What are the standards in your region? (Europe CE, Brazil INMETRO, etc)

- Findability: There are more than 80 different platforms hosting hardware projects. They all have different formats, user interfaces, etc. This makes finding your project, or even a project related to yours quite difficult. To solve this issue, the OpenKnowHow created a standard in the format of a simple file that can be edited and added to your project.


### Assignments
**Licensing**
- Choose a license or several licenses depending on the types of content you are providing.
- If you are using parts of other projects with licenses check if you attribute them correctly

**Findability**
- Follow these instructions to create a .yml file to include your project in openknowhow.org (You can use this online form to create the .yml file)

**Documentation**
- Go through the standards and see which applies for your project
- Revisit your documentation and adjust it.
- Follow our checklist to update your documentation so it is one step closer to fulfill DIN SPEC 3105
