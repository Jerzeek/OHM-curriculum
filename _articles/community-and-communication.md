### Description
If your project could benefit from having external contributors and a community, then you should make sure it is prepared in a way to attract them and make them feel welcome! Think about your past experiences as a newcomer to a new project. Communication is an important factor in how well others understand what your project is about, especially if they have a different background. Therefore, we will have a look at how you can communicate the different parts of your projects in a positive, jargon-free way.

### Goal of the week
Define the processes that will allow your project to manage input from users and collaborators, while keeping it a welcoming and friendly space
