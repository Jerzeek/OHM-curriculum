If your project could benefit from having external contributors and a community, then you should make sure it is prepared in a way to attract them and make them feel welcome.

The way you manage contributions has a significant impact on your project roadmap. Here we will take a look at concepts and tools that will help you polish your contributions workflow.

### Goal of the week
Define the processes that will allow your project to manage input from users and collaborators, while keeping it a welcoming and friendly space
<!--
### Assignments (to be distributed among submodules)
**Communication**
- Define your communication channels
- Create a communication piece
- Check the language you are using for jargon and try to rephrase descriptions to be understandable by people with a different background
**Community management**
- Think of the different roles in your project and the process of making decisions
- Write up some community guidelines (Code of Conduct) and be prepared to enforce them. If you don't know where to start, take a look at this very detailed example from Mozilla.
- Define how you want to manage contributions
- Create First Timers Only issues that walk newcomers through how to set up anything that may be required in the development environment-->
