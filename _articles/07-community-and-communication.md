As much as you’re driven by project creation, goals, and aims, in the end working open is really all about relationships: the working relationships you establish with your contributors, how those contributors come together to grow into a community, and how you as a leader can welcome them, and help them feel valued, engaged, and excited by the project. 

In this module you’ll learn how to build two kinds of communities– the large, vibrant, ever changing and growing community of open project contributors, and smaller, closer-knit network of people who support your leadership. We will also go through some relevant concepts when growing communities that may not apply to your project right away, but that are useful for having in your project plans.

### Goal of the week
Define the processes that will allow your project community to grow in a way that everyone gets something out from it, while fostering a welcoming and friendly space

<!--
### Assignments (to be distributed among submodules)
**Communication**
- Define your communication channels
- Create a communication piece
- Check the language you are using for jargon and try to rephrase descriptions to be understandable by people with a different background
**Community management**
- Think of the different roles in your project and the process of making decisions
- Write up some community guidelines (Code of Conduct) and be prepared to enforce them. If you don't know where to start, take a look at this very detailed example from Mozilla.
