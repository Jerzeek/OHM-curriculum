The Open Hardware Makers Series teaches you best practices in “working open” -- a way of working where:

* **_everyone_ is invited to collaborate on something amazing,**
* **and any new product or knowledge is shared widely and freely.**

This is for anyone starting up or leading open projects-- project leads, collaborators, or small groups of co-leaders responsible for project success and growth.

This guide is originally intended to support participants of the mentorship program as they progress towards making their projects open. However, you can still follow it along on your own.
