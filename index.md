The Open Hardware Makers Series teaches you best practices in “working open” in hardware projects -- a way of working where:

* **_everyone_ is invited to collaborate on something amazing,**
* **and any new product or knowledge is shared widely and freely.**

This is for anyone starting up or leading an open hardware project-- project leads, collaborators, or small groups of co-leaders responsible for project success and growth

This guide is originally intended to support participants of the mentorship program as they progress towards making their projects open. However, you can still follow it along on your own.

>During 2020, a grant from Mozilla Foundation allowed us to enrich the content in this guide via a community consultation and a review by an experts panel. You can always suggest improvements by clicking on the "suggest changes" link found at the bottom of every page.
